# Project 1

This project works with a supermarket sales dataset with both regression and classification tasks to analyze the sales data.

## Code Implementation

This project repository contains three files namely:   
- Project 1 - Building & Evaluating ML Algorithms - Answers.ipynb
- Training.ipynb
- Test.ipynb

The first contains all the code to tarin and test the models while explaining the questios posed as well.   
The Training notebook contains the code to train every model, and save the trained models in the pickle file.   
The Test notebook contains the code to test every model after importing the saved pickle file.

Run all the cells in both notebooks in the presented order. The scores reporting has been done in both notebooks. For any explanations about the dataset and the models, refer to Project 1 - Building & Evaluating ML Algorithms - Answers.ipynb or the IEEE format Report.
